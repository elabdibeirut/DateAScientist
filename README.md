# OKCupid Astrological Sign Prediction Project:  DateAScientist

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of data obtained from the online dating application OKCupid. With the increasing popularity of dating apps in recent years, there is now an abundance of data available for understanding how individuals experience romance and seek compatible matches.

The primary objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict an OkCupid user's astrological sign using other variables from their profiles. Astrological signs are considered important by many users when seeking potential matches. In cases where users do not provide their signs, the project aims to predict them accurately.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis is profiles.csv, provided by Codecademy.com. Each row in the dataset represents an OkCupid user, and the columns contain their responses to various profile questions, including both multiple-choice and short-answer formats.

## Methodology

The project will follow these key steps:

1. Scoping: Defining the project goals, data sources, and the main research question.
2. Data Preparation: Cleaning and organizing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values if required.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using descriptive statistics and data visualization to gain insights into the distribution, count, and relationship between variables.
4. Machine Learning Model: Developing a supervised learning classification model to predict users' astrological signs.
5. Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using a validation dataset, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Kappa score.

## Results

The project aims to provide insights into the prediction of astrological signs based on users' profile information. The final selected machine learning model will be evaluated to determine its effectiveness in making accurate predictions. The findings may shed light on the importance of astrological signs in dating app matches and the feasibility of imputing missing sign data for improved user experience.

Please note that the final selected algorithm did not perform significantly better than basic guessing, indicating the need for further improvements to enhance the model's predictive power.
